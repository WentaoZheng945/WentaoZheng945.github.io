I am currently a second-year master's student specializing in Transportation Engineering at Tongji University. I am part of the Traffic Operation and Simulation group (TOPsp [tops.com](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/)), led by Professor Jian Sun. My supervisor is Associate Professor Tian Ye [Tian Ye's homepage](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1185.htm). My research primarily revolves around accelerating testing procedures for autonomous vehicles and the automated generation of driving scenarios.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
