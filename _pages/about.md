I am currently a second-year master's student specializing in Transportation Engineering at Tongji University. I am part of the Traffic Operation and Simulation group [(TOPs)](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/)), led by Professor Jian Sun. My supervisor is Associate Professor [Tian Ye](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1185.htm). My research primarily revolves around accelerating testing procedures for autonomous vehicles and the automated generation of driving scenarios.
